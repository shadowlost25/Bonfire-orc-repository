# Old Outback Orcs - Bonfire v.0.30.0 and below.

These are NPCs that are set to spawn in the Old Outback. They will not appear in the New Outback, however they are still accessible by opening the Command Console with the F1 key and entering the below command:

```
travel World1
```

**A word of warning:** Sex-based dialogue was re-worked in v0.31.X to make Orcs output the game's vanilla text after a sex scene ends, instead of the mod creator's intended speech. As a consequence, any Orcs who are supposed to speak or run extra commands after sex do not work properly and must be reworked for the proper dialogue to appear.

Mod makers who are trying to retrieve their Orcs in the old outback can find a workaround in this tutorial: https://hogswilds-bonfire.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Custom_NPCs#Section_7_-_Post-Sex_Dialogue
